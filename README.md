<h2> A CookedWiki Alfred Workflow to open recipes in a readable and scalable format. </h2>

Created simple workflow to
Open up Recipes in an easy to read format with cook. To use this tool, either have the website with the recepie URL on in Chrome/Safari, then type 'cook' to automatically grab the url and generate the recipie. Or manually enter the url with cook <url>. It works with any URL, and gives you the option to scale the recipe.
